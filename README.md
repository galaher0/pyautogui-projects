Two simple projects automating clicking Twitch channel bonus points and freebitco.in site

# twitch_clicker.py

Script automatically clicks channel bonus points button once it emerges on a web browser. It can work in two regimes: when one or two streams working in separate windows.

# bitcoin_clicker.py

Site freebitco.in provides an opportunity to earn up to $200 in bitcoin value once every hour for clicking captcha and roll buttons. Captcha doesn't need to be solved, so a simple multi-step clicking process can be developed.
